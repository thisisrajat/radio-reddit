### Radio Reddit

__ How to use this script? __

  Open Terminal or equivalently Command Prompt on Windows and run execute the following:

  ```
    $ python radio-reddit.py [ station name ]
  ```

  These station names are accepted: main, indie, rock, metal, random

  If you encountered WindowsError, you probably should refer path_handlers.py and follow the instructions I've written for exactly this problem.

####Todo

 [] Create shorthand for station names. Who want to type all..
 [] Handle more errors, like the WindowsError with VLC's path. 
 [] Take music player name or path (for windows guys) and stream radio on it :smile:
